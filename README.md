#HomeScreen:

Displays a list of products in a grid layout on the screen.
Each product is represented by a container containing its image, price, name, and brand.
Tapping on a product container navigates the user to the SecondScreen to view detailed information about that product.


#SecondScreen:

Shows detailed information about a specific product.
Displays the product's image, price, name, and brand.
Allows the user to mark the product as a favorite by tapping on a heart icon, which toggles its state.
Provides an "Add to cart" button, which currently doesn't have functionality implemented (// Handle add to cart action comment).
Overall, this Flutter app provides a basic interface for browsing and viewing details of products, with the ability to mark favorites and potentially add items to a shopping cart.
